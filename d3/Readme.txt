Insights: 

From the generated visualizations I could see that there very few war deaths which was expected. But there were many Suprising elements too. Such as War deaths 
in russia is almost equal to that of fire deaths and it wasn't low. From scatter plot it was easy to see which cause had more than compared to others. Brazil had
more number of murder deaths than others. Hence we could say that crime rate in Brazil could me more compared to rest. The most suprising thing was that suicide 
deaths were the frequent cause of death in most countries which was concerning. It had most deaths among 5 of 8 countries I choose. India and Bangaldesh had more 
deaths compared to rest of the countries, hence I think the fire department in these two countries in weak compared  to the rest.
